This software enables rapid generation of object detection research.

- Provide this script with imgFiles (Glob of dataset images) and an annotation file (In COCO JSON format) and will return metrics.
- Metrics are the full output of COCO and TIDE (Toolbox for Identifying Object Detection Errors) combined and per class.


Dependencies:
PyCOCOTools == 2.0.4
TIDE == https://github.com/dbolya/tide/pull/21
pytorch == 1.11.0
torchvision == 0.12.0
tqdm == 4.64.0

Just to note that your TIDE library will need to be updated as suggested below due to the repo no longer being updated.
